    What is Linux?
  </h2>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Linux is the name for a family of open-source, Unix-like operating systems
    based on the Linux kernel. First released by Linus Torvalds in 1991, the
    Linux kernel is at the core of these systems. A Linux
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">distribution</strong> (or distro) packages
    the kernel with system software and libraries, many of which are provided by
    the GNU Project.

    Reasons You Shouldn&#39;t Daily Drive Linux
  </h3>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Before diving in, it’s important to recognize a few scenarios where Linux
    may not be the best option for your daily driver:
  </p>
  <h4>1. You Rely on Windows-Only Software</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    If you depend on software like
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Adobe Photoshop</strong>,
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Premiere</strong>, or
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Microsoft 365</strong>, Linux might not be
    the best fit. While some alternatives exist, such as
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">LibreOffice</strong> for Microsoft Office,
    these alternatives might not meet all your needs, especially for
    resource-intensive tasks. Running these programs through compatibility
    layers like <strong style="font-weight: 600">Wine</strong> often results in
    poor performance.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    A lot of developers even still primarily prioritize releasing on Windows and
    MacOS, and Linux support, although on the rise, is still relatively scarce.
  </p>
  <h4>2. You&#39;re Not Prepared to Troubleshoot</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Linux can be more technical than other operating systems, depending on the
    distro you choose. Linux tends to be a pragmatic piece of software, and in a
    lot of cases you will need to pull up a terminal to enter commands, install
    software, or troubleshoot issues. Some distros, like Ubuntu, Pop!_OS, and
    Linux Mint, offer user-friendly interfaces and polished GUIs, but technical
    issues can still arise. If you&#39;re not comfortable with command-line
    tools, Linux may not be for you.
  </p>
  <h4>3. Hardware Support Can Be Hit or Miss</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Linux hardware compatibility has improved significantly in recent years, but
    it can vary depending on the specific components and peripherals. Linux
    works well with most CPUs from Intel and AMD. And most x86 and x86_64 CPUs
    will work. ARM also has good support in devices like the Raspberry Pi and
    most modern Chromebooks. However, modern MacBooks with the M-Series chips
    will only work with one distro (check out

      href="https://asahilinux.org/about/"
      >Asahi</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    GPU support is quite different; Intel&#39;s integrated GPUs (Iris and UHD)
    are very well supported. AMD/ATI&#39;s have open-source drivers (AMDGPU),
    which have great support for both integrated and discrete GPUs, and recent
    AMD cards are often supported out of the box.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Now, NVIDIA is now... pretty good! Recently,

      >NVIDIA Open-Sourced their driver</a
    >. While NVIDIA has started open-sourcing its GPU drivers, the process is
    ongoing. You may still experience some instability or performance issues
    compared to AMD&#39;s open-source drivers.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Basic peripherals like standard USB peripherals like keyboards, mice, and
    webcams work out of the box. Now specialized peripherals like gaming
    keyboards, mice, or other peripherals with RGB lighting or programmable keys
    might have limited support. Some vendors don&#39;t provide Linux software,
    but there are open-source tools.

    are excellent community solutions that allow Linux users to control RGB
    lighting and gaming mouse/keyboard features. These projects have matured a
    lot, but support can still be uneven depending on the specific hardware
    model.

    Many printers work well with Linux using CUPS (Common Unix Printing System)

    Epson printers have limited or no Linux support. Scanners may require
    specific drivers and can sometimes be trickier to set up, depending on the
    manufacturer.

  <h4>4. Music Production Isn&#39;t Linux&#39;s Strong Suit (Yet)</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Music production on Linux has made significant strides in recent years, but
    it still faces challenges compared to platforms like Windows and macOS.
    Native Linux DAWs like <strong style="font-weight: 600">Ardour</strong>,
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Bitwig</strong>, and
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Tracktion</strong> have great features, but
    VST3 support, which is critical for many music producers (like me), is still
    underdeveloped. Linux VSTs like
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">LV2</strong>,
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">LADSPA</strong>, and
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">DSSI</strong> work well, but they are not
    widely adopted in the commercial music industry. Most VSTs can be run on
    Linux using tools like

    manual setup compared to Windows.
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">JACK</strong> and
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">ALSA</strong> both support MIDI devices,
    and most Linux DAWs are equipped to handle MIDI sequencing and routing.

    Why should I try Linux?
  </h2>
  <h4>1. It&#39;s free...</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Most Linux distributions are completely free to download and use. Some
    distributions offer paid versions with added support (e.g.,
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</strong> and
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Zorin OS Pro</strong>), but the free
    versions still have all the core functionality you need.
  </p>
  <h4>2. it&#39;s light...</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    It runs on almost anything (especially good on old hardware). Minimal
    hardware requirements are a lot less on Linux compared to Windows, though
    how much depends on the specific distro. Some Linux distributions are
    particularly designed for older hardware, such as
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Lubuntu</strong>,
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Puppy Linux</strong>, and
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Linux Lite</strong>. These systems can run
    on as little as 512 MB of RAM and older CPUs while still providing a usable
    desktop experience. For extremely resource-limited machines,
    <a
      style="color: #3b82f6; text-decoration: underline"
      onMouseOver="this.style.color='#0F0'"
      onMouseOut="this.style.color='#00F'"
      href="http://tinycorelinux.net/"
      >Tiny Core Linux</a
    >
    which runs on just
    <em>16MB of RAM!</em>
  </p>
  <h4>3. and it&#39;s fast</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    When games do run on Linux, they often perform exceptionally well. Linux’s
    lightweight nature and efficient resource management mean that it doesn’t
    carry the same overhead as Windows. Windows has numerous background
    processes that can consume CPU and memory, limiting gaming performance. On
    Linux, with its minimal resource usage, you’re often able to use more of
    your hardware’s potential.
  </p>
  <h4>4. No Unwanted Updates</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    One of Linux&#39;s greatest features is what it doesn&#39;t do. I already
    had my rant earlier, but I can keep on going. Microsoft&#39;s decisions for
    the future of Windows is like watching a car crash in really slow motion.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Updates on Windows are done automatically and can take <em>hours</em>. Not
    the case for Linux. In Linux, updates are managed through
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">package managers</strong> (like
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">apt</strong>,
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">dnf</strong>, or
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">pacman</strong>), and users have full
    control over when updates are applied. Moreover, Linux typically does not
    require reboots for most updates, except for kernel upgrades.
  </p>
  <h4>5. Security and Privacy by Design</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    The <strong style="font-weight: 600">open-source nature</strong> of Linux
    also allows security vulnerabilities to be discovered and patched quickly by
    the global community, unlike closed-source software where only the company
    can fix bugs. Linux’s
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">strict user privilege model</strong>
    ensures that most tasks run without root (administrator) access. This
    minimizes the risk of malware, as malicious programs need root permissions
    to make critical system changes. Also coupled with the lack of telemetry
    (<strong style="font-weight: 600">Ubuntu’s telemetry</strong> is minimal and
    opt-in, focusing mostly on system specs and package usage data. However,
    many privacy-focused users prefer to avoid telemetry altogether by using
    distros like <strong style="font-weight: 600">Debian</strong>,
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Arch</strong>, or
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Manjaro</strong>, which have no built-in
    telemetry).
  </p>
  <h4>6. Freedom and Community</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Freedom and choice are, in my eyes, the most important factors of Linux and
    free and open source software in general. The very alive and strong
    community that Linux has and Linux&#39;s trust in it&#39;s users to give
    them the freedom to do as they please is why I personally began using Linux.
    Because of its strong populous philosophy. The Linux philosophy is centered
    around the idea of freedom and trust for its users. Users are free to use
    the software as they see fit. The open source philosophy is built on the
    idea of collaboration and community. The belief that together we can create
    something greater than what any one individual could achieve alone. This
    collaborative approach to software development has led to the creation of a
    vast array of open source software projects, from operating systems like
    Linux to productivity tools like LibreOffice to social media platforms like
    Mastodon.
  </p>
  <p style="font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.625rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">
    Because of this quality, Linux is incredibly customizable and personable.
    Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, you can tweak almost every
    aspect of your Linux environment to suit your personal preferences. Whether
    you&#39;re looking for a traditional desktop experience or a minimalist,
    keyboard-driven setup, Linux can accommodate. You can even modify the core
    functionality of the system through different distros or by compiling your
    own
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Linux kernel</strong> to fit your needs.
    Your desktop is completely personable via
    <strong>Desktop Environments (DEs)</strong> like
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">GNOME</strong>,
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">KDE Plasma</strong>, <strong>Xfce</strong>,
    and <strong style="font-weight: 600">Cinnamon</strong> provide full-fledged
    graphical interfaces with their own sets of apps, window management systems,
    and workflows. They cater to different preferences, from highly visual (KDE)
    to minimal and lightweight (Xfce). Or maybe you&#39;d prefer a
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Window Managers (WMs)</strong>, like
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">i3</strong>,
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">Awesome</strong>, or
    <strong style="font-weight: 600">bspwm</strong>, are more focused on
    minimalism and efficiency. They allow for dynamic tiling and customization
    without
